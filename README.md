# Simple Rust based WebSocket Server

A simple Rust based Web Sockets server developed with the goal of learning more about Rust.

Note: I've tried to use as few dependencies as possible, including writing a simple HTTP server from scratch for the initial connection upgrade.

### How to run

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `cargo run` from the root
3. Go to https://websocketking.com/
4. Set the url to `ws://localhost:8082/ws` and send a text request
